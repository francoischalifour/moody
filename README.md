Moody is a web application that plays different music playlists according to a specific human emotion. It works with Spotify’s API to stream on the browser a random music playlist that is appropriate for the desired emotion selected by the user.

## Elevator Pitch

Moody exists to accentuate an emotion that the user is currently feeling and to make his experience as simple and fast as possible. The user doesn’t have to worry about looking for the right songs, Moody searches for an appropriate playlist and reproduces on the browser.
